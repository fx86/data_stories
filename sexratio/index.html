            The Indian Sex Ratio
        </h1>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Gaurav, aged 34 hails from the city of Rohtak, Haryana. He works as a
            domestic help and lives with his wife and 2 children. His wife is from Tamil
            Nadu and at first glance it might seem like a progressive, interstate marriage in a 
            state rife with rigid marriage laws but nothing could be further from the truth.
            </p>

            
            <p>
                He is one of the many Haryanvi men who were forced to find brides from other states,
                as years of rampant female foeticide and rigid societal structures resulted in 
                a drastic sex ratio. The lucrative trafficking business that sprung up to 
                meet the void consists of agents, who "price" a suitable bridge from other states. 
                The girl's family is usually poor and has more than one girl of "marriageabe age",
                who meets the groom on the day of her marriage and in most cases, lives the rest of 
                her life as a house maid with rarely any basic human rights.

                Haryana is not the only state with a skewed ratio, but it certainly is the worst hit.
                As per the National Family Health Scheme 2015-16, Haryana has the lowest sex ratio
                at 876 females per thousand males. Punjab, followed a close second at 905. Let's look at 
                how the remaining states are doing:

        <div class="story">
            <p>
                Going by the map above it may seem that it is only a handful of states which are
                facing this skewness, the rest of seem to have a ratio higher than 970. But, for
                a country to have a healthy sex ratio, not only should the states improve on their
                individual performances but they should be able to sustain them. The map below 
                shows the change in a state's sex ratio as compared to same in the previous 
                National Family Health Survey of 2005-06.

            <p>
                You can use the mouse cursor above each state in each map to compare their
                performances. In summary, NFHS 2015-16 saw 16 states observed a decrease in sex
                ratio in comparison to 12 states which saw an increase. Take the case of Punjab
                for instance. In the 2005-06 NFHS survey, its sex ratio hovered around 882 mark,
                which is almost as low as Haryana's. But in 2015-16, its numbers have improved
                by 23, and it stands at 905, which though is an improvement still leaves a
                shortage of 100 females of a balanced 1000/1000.
            </p>
            <p>
                The same inconsistent change between surveys is observable when we compare how
                the state performances with that  in the Census survey of 2011.

                During the Census survey 2011, the majority of states were shown to have a slight 
                increase in sex ratio, in comparison to the Census survey 2005. But when we switch to 
                NFHS - 2015, the majority fails to register an improvement in the sex ratio. 
            </p>
            <p>
                India, it seems to have a long way to walk on the tight rope towards a balanced
                sex ratio, if Gaurav's sons and other Haryanvi men are to find a Haryanvi bride.
